# Automation API Tests for AeroDataBox

## About The Project

This project contains automated API tests for the AeroDataBox API, accessed via RapidAPI. The tests are implemented using multiple tools and approaches:

* Selenium tests in Python (PyCharm)
* Postman test scripts
* Test cases documented in Excel (found in the STD file)

The AeroDataBox API provides comprehensive aviation data, including airport information, flight tracking, and aircraft details. This project aims to ensure the reliability and correctness of the API's responses through comprehensive automated testing.

### Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/)
* [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
* [Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel)
